            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Pokemon Nuzzling Platinum is a rom hack made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQl-MFplVR7P-V33DiMbZig" target="_blank">Nuzzle</a>. The original story of Pokemon Platinum has been left pretty much unchanged. But this rom hack "upgrates" certain parts of it.</p>
            <p>Normal Pokemon Platinum gives you access to 210 different Pokemon. Nuzzling Platinum gives you access to about 470, including 73 Pokemon from generation 5 or later. A.k.a. Pokemon that have never been available in the Sinnoh region. A list of these Pokemon can be found <a href="newpokemon.html">here</a>, though it might be more fun to discover these during a playthrough. Pokemon are also made accasible early on, as you are able to catch over 70 different Pokemon before the first Gym.</p>
            <p>Every Pokemon has also been modified, to make them more usuable or unique in this large pool of options. Things like their movesets, abilities and evolution methods have been changed. You can now for example evolve Trade Evolution Pokemon by level up or by using an item. Some Pokemon also have their stats improved a bit to make them more viable. And a few also have received a type change, more about that <a href="typechanges.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Besides the Pokemon, there are also other changes in the game. Some items and gift Pokemon are randomized. The difficulty has been increased a bit. And there are a number of quality of life changes:</p>

            <h2>Difficulty</h2>
            <p>The difficulty in this rom hack has been increased compared to the orignal Pokemon Platinum, but also not by too much.</p>
            <p>There are some rom hacks out there that are basically impossible to Nuzlocke without getting certain encounters and a lot of planning. This game isn't like that. (Not that there is anything wrong with games or hacks like that, but this hack isn't aimed to be like that)</p>
            <p>This game is designed to be beatable when doing a Nuzlocke. However, it is also not made to be in such a way that you are basically guaranteed to win. You will have to do some planning and will most definetely lose some party members. And you might even have to do multiple attemts of the game if you really want to beat it in Nuzlocke form. Just probably not 50+ attemts.</p>
            <p>Efforts have also been made to keep the levels of your opponents very balanced. If you just fight trainers you will probably do just fine experience wise and won't have to grind. And if you really feel like you need some extra levels, you can receive unlimited  Rare Candy in every Pokemart if desired.</p>
            <p>Trainer battles are also made to give less money as reward. To make money more of an actual resource that you have to manage.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 11px;font-weight: bold;margin-top: 7px;">Disclaimer, the game might be harder/easier than anticipated. The text above is what the difficulty is designed to be like. But this can not be guaranteed.</p>

            <h2>Randomized items</h2>
            <p>One of the major changes in this rom hack is that items you find in the overworld are randomized. Meaning each playthrough will give the player different items.</p>
            <p>This feature also has been balanced a bit, by introducing differently colored items/pokeballs you find on the overworld.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #D06050;">Red</span> balls are the most common, and give a randomized item out of a pool of mostly less usefull items.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #3B9DFF;">Blue</span> balls are better than the red ones, and usually contain items of more value.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #93796D;">Brown</span> balls are even better items than the blue ones.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #A84FFF;">Purple</span> balls are alway guaranteed to be valuable and rare items.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #ffc800;">Yellow</span> balls always contain a TM. Though other colors can be TMs too.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #168D6A;">Green</span> balls always contain an evolutionary item.</p>
            <p><span style="color: black;">White</span> balls aren't randomized. These will always contain the same item.</p>
            <p>Because of these different colored balls, you will not find things like Master Balls or Full Restores at the start of your journey. And will also not find useless Potions right before challenging the Elite 4. This keeps it somewhat balanced.</p>
            <p>But it still makes it different enough to make each playthrough more unique. A full list of what items can be found inside which color can be found <a href="items.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Randomized fossils</h2>
            <p>The Root, Claw, Skull and Armor Fossils have been removed and replaced with the Aquatc (Aquatic), Aerial, Seed and Mammal Fossil. These new fossils will not contain the same Pokemon each time, but isntead it will be a random Pokemon.</p>
            <p><span>Aquatc</span> fossils will contain a Pokemon that either is associated to water, or is made out of liquid itself.</p>
            <p><span>Aerial</span> fossils will contain a Pokemon that can fly or levitate.</p>
            <p><span>Seed</span> fossils will contain a plant based Pokemon.</p>
            <p><span>Mammal</span> fossils will contain mostly mammal like Pokemon, though there are some exceptions.</p>
            <p>Just like in the normal games, these fossils can be revived in the Oreburgh Mining Museum.</p>

        <div class="aboutpage__text">
            <h2>Randomized eggs</h2>
            <p>Just like in normal Pokemon Platinum, the player receives 2 eggs during a playthrough. One from Cynthia in Eterna City, and one from Riley on Iron Island. But unlike normal Pokemon Platinum, these will not always be a Togepi and Riolu egg. Instead, the pokemon that's inside will be random each time.</p>
            <p>However, the Pokemon will always be the first stage of a not artificially created Pokemon. So no Magnemite, Voltorb or Mewtwo but besides that it could be anything from Pidgey to Charmander to Kyogre.</p>
            <p>The amount of steps it takes to hatch an egg have also been decreased. The less "valuable" a Pokemon the quicker the egg hatches.</p>

            <h2>New Pokemon</h2>
            <p>As mentioned in the summary above, there are 73 Pokemon added to this game from generation 5 and later. Which these are can be found <a href="newpokemon.html">here</a>. However, randomly encountering them during a playthrough withour prior knowledge might be more fun.</p>
            <p>Some of these new Pokemon include new evolutions to Pokemon that already existed in generation 4. However, not every Pokemon that is an evolution to a generation 1, 2, 3 or 4 Pokemon that has been introduced in generation 5 or later, is included in this game. For example, this game does not include Sylveon, Farigiraf or Alolan Exeggutor.</p>

            <h2>Pokemon changes</h2>
            <p>Every Pokemon has undergone changes in this Rom Hack. Some only have received movepool changes. Most also have different abilities. And a small group even have a new typing (these can be found <a href="typechanges.html">here</a>).</p>
            <p>This has all been done to make each Pokemon more unique and interesting and to make weak Pokemon a bit more viable.</p>
            <p>Some evolution methods have also been changed. Mostly to make evolutions easier but some have also been made a tiny bit more difficult to balance them out a bit. Evolutionary stones have also been made to work on almost every non-starter Pokemon of the type corresponding to the stone's element. And Pokemon that normally only evolve by stone now can also evolve by level up.</p>

            <h2>Known issues</h2>
            <p>The game has been tested many times however, sometimes issues slip through. Here is a list of known issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There have been reports of the game freezing after the 2 Galactic grunts in Celestic Town walk away, however this does not happen in most cases. Just in case however, it is recommended to save the game before interacting with them, and to not use speed up while doing so.</li>
                <li>When fighting the first Elite4 member at the Pokemon League, the trainer sprite glitches a bit for a second.</li>
                <li>Frosmoth can't learn HM Defog even though it really kinda should.</li>
                <li>There might be a few spelling and grammar mistakes in this rom hack. This hack was created by only 1 person, and she has dyslexia and her main language isn't English, so apologies in advance.</li>
